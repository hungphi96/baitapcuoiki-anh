Attached to the wish is a pretty deep meaning. In the past, horses were the most convenient means of transportation. Because horses include many factors of running fast, endurance, intelligence, loyalty. Human life in the past was very close to this animal. Horses and humans shared the same sufferings in life, in labor, in trade and even when going to war against the enemy. Whenever going to work away from home, the horse is the companion, sometimes for a whole month or a year. When going to battle, often 'go ten to one'. Therefore, 'unique' - 'with a horse coming back' - is a metaphor for success because people have everything. Therefore, the image of the returning horse is seen as a symbol of victory. Or at least when the horse comes home alone, the owner still doesn't lose it, this is considered no loss. If domestic horses still bring more wild horses, they have already started to 'profit'. Wishing a successful code is not only suitable for business people. Which is even very suitable for those who conquer the highway. This greeting is often used on New Year's occasions. Especially in the year of the horse, this wish becomes even more relevant and meaningful.",
